## My analysis projects portfolio with custom css

This site is my analyst portfolio, that I've based on the [quick-portfolio](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio) provided by @evanca; which was a modified version of the [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.
It includes custom css and a slightly modified landing page layout with a very basic menu.
